# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).


## [13.0.5] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- Curator `ready` now awaits `BlacksmithAPI.waitForReady()` (when provided by Blacksmith) before registering with Blacksmith, registering settings, and calling `initializeCurator`, so `BlacksmithUtils` and other consumer globals are wired before use. Avoids `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'postConsoleAndNotification')` when Curator’s `ready` ran before Blacksmith finished `markReadyForConsumers()`.
- `HookManager.initialize()` guards the startup notification: if `globalThis.BlacksmithUtils` is not ready, logs to the console instead of throwing.

## [13.0.4] - 2026-03-14

### Changed
- Curator no longer owns or initializes Blacksmith's current-turn and targeted token indicator behavior. That feature now lives entirely in Blacksmith.

### Removed
- Removed the orphaned turn-indicator, targeted-indicator, and related token movement/visibility helper code from `scripts/token-image-utilities.js`.
- Removed the stale `targetedIndicatorEnabled` fallback reference from `scripts/manager-image-cache.js`.



## [13.0.3] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed
- Image Replacements window and cache status now show cache size (MB) for the active mode (Token vs Portrait) instead of always using the token cache. File count and age were already correct; size now uses the same mode-specific cache/setting.

## [13.0.2] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- Menubar tools split into **Replace Token** and **Replace Portrait**; each opens the replacement window in the corresponding mode.
- Right-click context menus on both menubar tools (Blacksmith Context Menu API): **Open Replace Token/Portrait Images** and **Replace Canvas Token/Portrait Images**.
- Static `TokenImageReplacementWindow.runUpdateCanvas(mode, modeLabel)` so canvas image updates can be run without opening the window (used by context menu and for future API).

### Changed
- Replacement window `openWindow(opts)` now accepts `opts.mode` ('token' or 'portrait'); existing window switches mode when opened with a different mode.
- Removed `api-helpers.js`; all code now calls `BlacksmithUtils` directly (`getSettingSafely`, `postConsoleAndNotification`, `playSound`). Blacksmith bridge import added in scripts that use the API.

## [13.0.1] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed
- Addressed issue where sound and roll table selection dropdowns were empty in settings by dynamically updating choices based on the new Blacksmith Constants API.

### Added
- Formally registered the module with the `BlacksmithModuleManager` to ensure seamless inter-module communication.

## [13.0.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- Initial extraction of Curator from Blacksmith.
- Token and portrait image replacement features.
- Dead token conversion mechanics.
- Loot token conversion, settings, and tables.
